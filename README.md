## Current Work
**Kovari — AI-Assisted Data Cleaning Platform**  
I’m currently engineering a system that helps teams clean and structure messy data, and recieve near-instant predictive analytics. We focuse on *human-in-the-loop* correction, guided column mapping, and scalable backend processing, blending practical data engineering with applied machine learning.

## Previous Projects 
### **OracleZero — AI Portfolio Management Platform**
[OracleZero – AI Portfolio Management Platform](https://ozero.manovay.info/)
Built an LLM-based portfolio optimizer trained on 3 years of S&P 500 data using LoRA fine-tuning.  
Deployed automated trading through the **Alpaca API** with **RunPod inference servers**, tracking live portfolio performance via Flask + Plotly dashboards.  
Achieved +5.12% cumulative return and strong Sharpe stability versus the S&P 500 benchmark.

### **AP Study Guide Generator**
[Repository](https://github.com/manovay/AP-Study-Guide-Generator)  
Automated a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that scrapes, parses, and indexes AP exam PDFs for context-aware question answering.  
Used Selenium, PyPDF2, MiniLM embeddings, FAISS, and GPT-4o to achieve 85% QA accuracy with <5% hallucination rate across 200+ queries.

### **Environmental Disaster Classifier**
[Repository](https://github.com/manovay/Environmental-Disaster-Classifier-)  
Built a full ML pipeline using NASA’s API data (6,700+ events, 10 years) to classify disaster types from geospatial coordinates.  
Trained a KNN model (99.3% accuracy) with feature scaling and class-balancing, improving minority recall by 18%.  
Deployed Mapbox visualizations to highlight regional disaster trends.

### **Group Movie Recommender**
[Repository](https://github.com/manovay/movie-recc)  
Developed a collaborative filtering system using PyTorch + FastAPI with WebSocket-based real-time updates.  
Supported 10+ concurrent sessions and <200ms synchronization latency, achieving 85%+ top-5 accuracy.
